#A stack is the right choice for an undo / redo system because itâ€™s design is more closely related to a Last-in, First-out method. This means that for problems that involve back tacking or reverse operations, a stack is the best way to go. What a LIFO behavior means is last action is the first behavior that is input is the first one to be processed. So each action is put onto a stack and allows for the user to back track easily. 
#A queue for the help desk system is a more efficient way to handle with the matter because the orders have to be handled with as them come, in order. This is more of a first-in, first-out method which means the first thing that enters into the program will be the first thing out. This program allows for each ticket to be completed in order.
#To differentiate between the stack and queue, we created our own rules for the functions rather than utilizing pythons. This is because python has more of a looser approach with append and such that does not allow for the full understanding of the stack data structure, along with the ability to manipulate items within the list rather than taking from the top. In my opinion, it also allows for easier understanding of the code and where exactly something went wrong because everything is pretty much broken down into easier parts.
